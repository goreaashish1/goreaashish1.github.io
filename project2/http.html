        <p id="phttp" class="fontsize">HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. <br/> It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.<br/> A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.<br/>Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). <br/>The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called <strong><em>requests</em></strong> and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called <strong><em>responses</em></strong>.<br/>Thus, HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser. The responses are sent by a server who first searches for the relevant document retrieves it and then sends it as a response message back to the client.<br/> <br/>
            Some Properites of HTTP:
            </p>
            <ul id ="pl" class="fontsize">
                <li>HTTP is simple: Its messages can be read and understood by humans. </li>
                <li>HTTP is Extensible: New functionality can be introduced easily and at any time.</li>
                <li>HTTP is Media Independent: Any type od data can be sent and received as long as both sender and receiver know how to handle the data being sent.</li>
            </ul>
