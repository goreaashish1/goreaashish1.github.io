            <h2 id = "origins">Origins</h2>  
            <p id = "p-origins">In August 1962, J.C.R. Licklider of M.I.T. discussed an idea of a “Galactic Network”. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data, programs and other such documents from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. The first major break-through in this direction was the packet-switching theory proposed by Leonard Kleinrock published in a paper in 1964. This theory was later was implemented in the ARPANET, which is considered as the predecessor of the modern day internet. The Internet as we know today is a gigantic hardware network of interconnected media devices. The largest content accessible through this internet is the World Wide Web.</p>






            <h2 id = "internet">Internet</h2>  <h2 id = "www">World Wide Web</h2>  
            <p id = "int">The internet, or net, is a term that refers to the Interconnection of Computer Networks. It is a massive mesh of millions of computers and smart devices, all connected by wires or wireless signals. Although it started in the 1960s as a military experiment in communication, the internet evolved into a public free broadcast forum in the '70s and '80s. <br />No single authority owns or controls the internet.<br /> No single set of laws governs its content. <br />You connect to the internet through a private internet service provider in your home or office or a public Wi-Fi network. </p>


            <p id = "w">In 1989, a growing collection of readable content was added to the internet — the World Wide Web. This massive content is accessible by connecting your media device in the form of digital data, images, documents, videos, articles and other forms of digital data as well. <br />The web is the mass of HTML pages and images that travel through the internet's hardware. <br />You may hear the expressions "Web 1.0," "Web 2.0," and the "Invisible Web" to describe these billions of webpages.</p>

        
        
                    
            
            
        
         
            <h2 id="term">Some important terms</h2>
        
            <h3 id="email">Email</h3>
            <p id="p-email">Email is a massive subnetwork inside the internet. We trade written messages along with file attachments through email. While it takes time, email provides the business value of maintaining a paper trail for conversations.</p>
            
            
            <h3 id="mosaic">Mosaic</h3>
            <p id="p-mosaic">Mosaic was one of the first GUI-based internet browsers. It allowed users to utilize protocols like FTP and other early internet protocols like Gopher in addition to browsing the internet. Mosaic was named because of its support for multiple internet protocols(Crockford, 2011). Mosaic quickly became popular due to its easy to use and install design, the use of in-line pictures(The first browser to do so), and its reliability. Mosaic was released in January of 1993</p>
            
            <h3 id="gopher">Gopher</h3>
            <p id="p-gopher">Gopher was a software that allowed you to look for Internet resources, using menus, as if they were all in the same place (or on the same server). This menu driven software consisted a simple client-server model and used the Intenet Gopher Protocol. It supported storage, search and retrieval of all types of document data. This also meant no images and no videos.</p>
            
            <h3 id="ftp">FTP</h3>
            <p id="p-ftp">File Transfer Protocol, is a widely used network protocol for transferring files between computers over a TCP/IP based network. It is the second most popular protocol used today. FTP has been around for over four decades, and with time it’s encryption standards and transfer functionalities has seen significant changes. FTP users authenticate themselves normally in the form of a username and password.</p>
